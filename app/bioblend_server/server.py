                                        Used for tool/workflow recommendations, To respond accurately when asked about the available tools, datasets, or workflows in the galaxy instance.
                                        used only for gathering information to **respond to galaxy related queries**.

                                    Always keep querying and executing strictly separate in purpose and usage.

    Fetch detailed information on Galaxy tools, workflows, datasets, and invocations.

    This tool handles all information requests about Galaxy entities, based on
    the `query_type` (tool, workflow, dataset) and the user's `query`.
    Use `entity_id` only when the user's query explicitly includes an ID.

    Args:
        query: The user's query message that needs a response, accompanied by full and detailed contextual information.
        query_type: The type of Galaxy entity the query needs a response for, with one of three values: "tool", "dataset", or "workflow".
                    Select "workflow" for general workflow details and specific workflow invocation details.
        entity_id: Optional parameter. Provide this only when the user's query explicitly includes an ID,
                   allowing retrieval of information by that specific entity ID.

    Returns:
        A string containing the detailed Galaxy information and the response to the user's query.
