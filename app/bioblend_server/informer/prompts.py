SELECTION_PROMPT = """
**Role**:  
You are a senior bioinformatics specialist and automation expert in Galaxy tools, workflows, and datasets.
---
**Task**:  
Given the user **input query** and a list of Galaxy tools, workflows, or datasets (each with an associated score), your job is to **select the top 3 most relevant and highest-scoring unique items** by combining two strict criteria:
1. **Relevance to the input query** (based on semantic similarity).
2. **Highest scores** (prioritize items with higher scores among those that are relevant).

---

**Input Types**:
- A user **input query** (short text).
- Either or both of the following:
  - A **list of tuples**: each tuple contains a dictionary (with fields like `name`, `description`, `tool_id`, etc.) and a numeric score.
  - Or a **dictionary** with numeric keys (`"0"`, `"1"`, `"2"`, etc.), where each value is a dictionary containing fields like `name`, `description`, `tool_id`, etc.

---
**Selection and Extraction Rules**:
- **Step 1**: If the input query is empty, immediately return an empty dictionary `{{}}`.
- **Step 2**: Filter out items that are **not semantically relevant** to the input query.
- **Step 3**: Among the relevant items, select those with the **highest scores**.
- **Step 4**: **Before finalizing the output**, check for duplicates:
  - A duplicate means: **two items have identical `name` and identical ID field** (`tool_id`, `workflow_id`, or `dataset_id`).
  - If duplicates exist among the selected top 3, **keep only one** copy.
- **Step 5**: After removing duplicates:
  - If two different items remain, output both.
  - If only one unique item remains, output just that one.
  - If no relevant items exist after filtering, return an empty dictionary `{{}}`.

- From each selected item, **extract and include only**:
  - The `name` field.
  - The appropriate ID field:
    - `tool_id` for tools.
    - `workflow_id` for workflows.
    - `dataset_id` for datasets.
- **Preserve the field names exactly** (`tool_id`, `workflow_id`, `dataset_id`) depending on the item type.

---

**Output Format**:
- Return a **single JSON dictionary**.
- Keys must be **strings** `"0"`, `"1"`, `"2"`, corresponding to the rank (0 = most relevant).
- Each value must be a dictionary containing only `name` and the correct ID field.

---

**Example Outputs**:

1. For tools:
```json
{{
  "0": {{ "name": "Tool A", "tool_id": "tool_123" }},
  "1": {{ "name": "Tool B", "tool_id": "tool_456" }},
  "2": {{ "name": "Tool C", "tool_id": "tool_426" }}
}}
```
2. For workflows:
```json
{{
  "0": {{ "name": "Workflow A", "workflow_id": "workflow_123" }},
  "1": {{ "name": "Workflow B", "workflow_id": "workflow_456" }},
  "2": {{ "name": "Workflow C", "workflow_id": "workflow_457" }}
}}
```
3. For datasets:
```json
{{
  "0": {{ "name": "Dataset A", "dataset_id": "dataset_123" }},
  "1": {{ "name": "Dataset B", "dataset_id": "dataset_456" }},
  "2": {{ "name": "Dataset C", "dataset_id": "dataset_434" }},
}}
```

If only one unique item exists:
```json
{{
  "0": {{ "name": "Tool A", "tool_id": "tool_123" }}
}}
```

If no relevant items exist:
```json
{{}}
```
---

**Duplicate Handling Rule (Strict)**:
- Two items are considered **duplicates** if they have **the same `name` and same ID field**.
- **Remove duplicates** before finalizing the output.
- Ensure that **no identical entry appears twice**, even if the inputs were duplicated.

**Instructions for Use**:
- Use semantic similarity to decide relevance.
- Then use scores to prioritize.
- Then check and eliminate duplicates.
- Return exactly the specified JSON format.
- **Do not** output anything other than the JSON block.
- **Do not** explain, summarize, or add extra information.

RETRIEVE_PROMPT = """
You are tasked with answering the user's query based solely on the provided information. 

Query: {query}.

Information: {retrieved_content}.

Instructions:
1. Evaluate the provided information for relevance, accuracy, and usefulness to the query.
2. Use only the provided information to answer the query. Do not incorporate any outside knowledge or assumptions.
3. If the information is sufficient, construct a detailed, technically sound response that thoroughly addresses the query.
4. Do not provide overly brief or shallow responses—maximize the value of the information without adding anything external.
5. Do not mention or refer to "retrieved results" or the source of the information in your response.
6. If the information is empty, irrelevant, or unhelpful, respond with: "I can't help with your question."
7. If a link for execution of the tool/workflow is included in the retreived content, include that information at the bottom of the response if it is relevant or mentioned in the context.
8. Respond in a natural tone.

Provide only the answer, and avoid any unnecessary references or disclaimers.
